# Learning-OpenGL
Learning-OpenGL is the repository I will be building through my entire process of learning OpenGL. I will start this project going through all the videos made by The Cherno about OpenGL, and then I will read books and more information on the topic in order to advance my learning and understanding of rendering, engine graphics and OpenGL in particular.
